# 🚀 Crypto Staking Platform - Services Status

## 🟢 Running Services

### Infrastructure Services (Docker)
| Service | Status | URL | Credentials |
|---------|--------|-----|-------------|
| Consul | ✅ Running | http://localhost:8500 | - |
| RabbitMQ | ✅ Running | http://localhost:15672 | admin/admin123 |
| Prometheus | ✅ Running | http://localhost:9090 | - |
| Grafana | ✅ Running | http://localhost:3001 | admin/admin123 |

### Application Services (Local)
| Service | Status | URL | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Frontend | ✅ Running | http://localhost:3000 | Next.js dev server |
| API Gateway | 🔄 Compiling | http://localhost:8080 | Rust compilation in progress |
| Ethereum Node | 🔄 Compiling | http://localhost:8081 | Rust compilation in progress |

## 📊 Service Access Points

### 1. **Frontend** - http://localhost:3000
- Next.js application with staking dashboard
- Shows available blockchain networks
- Displays staking options and APR rates

### 2. **Consul UI** - http://localhost:8500
- Service discovery dashboard
- View registered services
- Health check status

### 3. **RabbitMQ Management** - http://localhost:15672
- Message broker dashboard
- Queue monitoring
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### 4. **Prometheus** - http://localhost:9090
- Metrics collection
- Query interface
- Targets status at http://localhost:9090/targets

### 5. **Grafana** - http://localhost:3001
- Monitoring dashboards
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## 🔍 Quick Health Checks

```bash
# Check API Gateway (once compiled)
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check Ethereum Node (once compiled)
curl http://localhost:8081/health

# List services in Consul
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/services
```

## 📝 Notes

1. **Rust Services**: First compilation takes 3-5 minutes due to dependency downloads
2. **Frontend**: Fully functional and can be accessed immediately
3. **Infrastructure**: All supporting services are operational
4. **Development Mode**: All services running in development/debug mode

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once Rust services finish compiling:
1. API Gateway will be available at port 8080
2. Ethereum node service will register with Consul
3. Frontend will be able to communicate with backend
4. Metrics will start appearing in Prometheus

## 🛠️ Useful Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker logs consul
docker logs rabbitmq
tail -f /tmp/api-gateway.log
tail -f /tmp/ethereum-node.log

# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose-infra.yml down
pkill -f "cargo run"
pkill -f "next dev"
```
